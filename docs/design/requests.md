# Shared-component requests

Module agents (A–D) never edit `src/ui`, `src/map`, `src/api`, `src/lib`, `src/state` or
`src/app`. When a screen needs a change there (a new prop, a variant, a helper, a bug fix), add an
entry below. F0b, or the lead after merge, makes the change and marks it done.

Format:

```
## <short title>
- From: <module> (<screen, e.g. D6>)
- Where: <file or component>
- Need: <what and why, in one or two sentences>
- Status: open | done (<commit>)
```

## Notes from F0a (contracts that differ slightly from the spec text)

- `AlertStatusLine` navigates itself: the compact AlertBox opens `/more/alerts/:id`, "+N more ›" opens `/more/alerts` (with `?route=` for scope "route"). `useAlerts()` also exposes `retry()` for its "Try again".
- `TimeValue` renders its own status word (or "Leaves before you get there"), so screens never pair a StatusWord with a time by hand. `DepTimes` (src/ui) renders "16 min · 46 min" with the offline rule applied.
- `Button` has `pressed` (toggle pills: Save, Track Bus Stop) and `ariaLabel`. `ListRow` has `href`, `checked`, `sub`, `leading`. `SectionHeader` has `note` ("To be confirmed by METRO") and `id` (anchors such as `#reduced`). `Dialog` has `open` / `onClose`. `StepList` has `currentIndex` ("You are here") and `TimelineStep.duration`. `BayDiagram` has `handAuthored` and `routesByBay` for tile labels.
- `NearbyStopCard.walkFrom` has an optional `name` (the full place name, for the a11y label). `SavedStopRow` has `moreSaved` for "+2 saved ›".
- Explore screens render their sheet with `ExploreSheet` (src/app/layouts/ExploreChrome.tsx), which is the layout's `BottomSheet` bound to `useSheet()`. Snap and `minHalf` reset when the path changes.
- `useWalkDistance(from, stopId, seedM?, seedSource?)` records the seed, so pass `/nearby`'s distance with `"osrm"` when `walkSource === "osrm"`; `recordWalkDistance()` is how D8 reports OSRM's answer.
- `useMapCenter()` (src/map/scene.ts) gives the map centre for the 300 m "Search this area" check; the layout's pill navigates to `/explore?at=<centre>&label=this area`.
- `useOnline()` lives in `src/state/online.ts`; `useLang()` in `src/i18n`.
